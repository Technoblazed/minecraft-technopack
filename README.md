## Introduction & Background

Hi there! This is a new modpack I'm working on for friends and invited players only. The server will be live before the end of June 2017, and will focus on making as much as a community within the server as possible.

This modpack will be heavily modified, nerfing the majority of items within the game, so the pack remains fun to play after a week.

## Information

As this is more of a community modpack, suggestions will be taken for changes to the pack, as well as the addition/removal of mods where appropriate.

In order for these requests to be kept organised, please create an issue on this GitHub repository with all the information you deem relevant.

To apply for whitelisting, please email: `anthony@tech-no.me` with your Twitch name, and your minecraft username. Please ensure the capitalization is correct or you will be unable to connect if you are accepted!
